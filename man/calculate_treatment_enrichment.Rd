\usage{
calculate_treatment_enrichment(
  data,
  protein_id,
  is_significant,
  binds_treatment,
  group = NULL,
  treatment_name,
  plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame contains at least the input variables.}

\item{protein_id}{a character column in the \code{data} data frame that contains the protein
accession numbers.}

\item{is_significant}{a logical column in the \code{data} data frame that indicates if the
corresponding protein has a significantly changing peptide. The input data frame may contain
peptide level information with significance information. The function is able to extract protein
level information from this.}

\item{binds_treatment}{a logical column in the \code{data} data frame that indicates if the
corresponding protein binds to the treatment. This information can be obtained from different
databases, e.g. UniProt.}

\item{group}{optional, character column in the \code{data} data frame that contains information by
which the analysis should be grouped. The analysis will be performed separately for each of the
groups. This is most likely a column that labels separate comparisons of different conditions.
In protti the \code{asign_missingness()} function creates such a column automatically.}

\item{treatment_name}{a character value that indicates the treatment name. It will be included
in the plot title.}

\item{plot}{a logical value indicating whether the result should be plotted or returned as a
table.}
}
\value{
A bar plot displaying the percentage of all detect proteins and all significant proteins
that bind to the treatment. A Fisher's exact test is performed to calculate the significance of
the enrichment in significant proteins compared to all proteins. The result is reported as a
p-value. If \code{plot = FALSE} a contingency table in long format is returned.
}
\description{
Check for an enrichment of proteins interacting with the treatment in significantly changing
proteins as compared to all proteins.
